The bug in the given solution is a resource leak, which occurs when an object is acquired but not released after use. In this case, the `HttpURLConnection` object is created by calling `openConnection()` on the `URL` object, but it is not released after use in line 36. This can cause issues such as slowing down the application or causing memory leaks.

To fix the bug, you can add a call to `connection.disconnect()` after the `while` loop in line 35 to release the connection object. The updated code should look like this:
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws MalformedURLException, IOException {
        URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com/api");
        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        connection.setRequestMethod("POST");
        connection.setDoOutput(true);

        // Set the request body to an XML string
        String xmlString = "<root><element>value</element></root>";
        byte[] bytes = xmlString.getBytes("UTF-8");
        connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Length", Integer.toString(bytes.length));
        connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/xml");
        OutputStream outputStream = connection.getOutputStream();
        outputStream.write(bytes);
        outputStream.close();

        // Get the response from the server
        InputStream inputStream = connection.getInputStream();
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(line);
        }
        reader.close();

        connection.disconnect(); // Add this line to fix the resource leak issue
    }
} 
```
